UDP Broadcast message on 7890 to show card is alive. Has NCP_BOOT_SEQUENCE and S/N.
	Format: 0x4040 BOOT_SEQ=0x********(uint32) S/N=13 bytes(ASCII) Empty=43-0x00 0x0403

Open port to TCP 1027 and receive info about card.
Received metadata:
	Null terminated strings. One string per packet for mine but have seen the entire list in one packet before too...?
Tranmit two packets, one with with NCP_BOOT_SEQUENCE retransmitted.
	First: Addr=0x80 BOOT_SEQ=4 bytes(uint32)
		Returns 0x00
	Second: Addr=0x01 Card-ID=0x00000065(uint32) aka 101 ID
		Returns 0x00
Close TCP 1027.

Open TCP 1027, receive again, push two packets, one with scroll message, the other with known msg "Z_pciepa".
	First: Addr=0x20 Msg=Scroll msg ASCII ends with a null term 0x00.
		Max length undetermined.
		No immediate return/ack.
	Second: Addr=0x00 Data=0x00 "Z_pciepa" 0x00(10 ASCII bytes)
		No immediate return/ack.
	Card then sends a series of 16 single bytes (each of these are their own packet):
		0x00 0x01 0x04 0x05 0x00 0x01 0x04 0x00 0xff 0xff 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff 0x00 0x00
		This seems the same each time across different cards...

Open TCP 1029:
	Note: xx is verified contents for value, ?? is unverified.
	MSG FORMAT (Always double-word boundry, IE divisable by 4 bytes):
		0x** 0x00 0x** 0x**
		0x?? 0x00 0x?? 0x??
		String Length: 0x********
		String padded to nearest double word with 0x00
		String Length: 0x********
		String padded to nearest double word with 0x00
		0x?? 0x?? 0x?? 0x??  << Address for data for local stuff like IDevAnalyzerControl1029 setAnalyzeProp? may also just be data
		Data?
	MSGs sent to/from card with first 12 bytes in packet FinalPacket=0x80 Length-4=0x0000xx RSPCode=0x80 Token=0x??xxxx Unk1=0x????????
		FinalPacket bit is set if packet is the last in the series. If not set more packets to follow.
	MSGs should always(?) be transmitted with the RSPCode=0x80 and the return message with the same token will have 0x80 as-well
	MSGs from card as a broadcast about general info come with blank RSPCode and Token (0x00 0x000000).
	General empty return ACK to sent MSG comes in the form of BeginPacket=0x80 Length-4=0x000008 RSPCode=0x80 Token=??xxxx Unk1=0x00000000
	
	General status transmition from card every second from 0x80000088 0x00 0x000000 0x00000000
		Probably something to do with traffic and link status for real time graph
	
	What is Unk1???
